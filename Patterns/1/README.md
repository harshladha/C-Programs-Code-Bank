# Print Right-Angled Triangle Star Pattern

This C++ program prints a right-angled triangle made of asterisks (`*`) using nested loops.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- **Outer loop (`i`)** runs from 1 to 5 to control the number of rows.
- **Inner loop (`j`)** runs from 1 to `i` to print the required number of asterisks in each row.
- After each row, `cout<<"\n";` moves the cursor to the next line.
- The result is a right-angled triangle with 5 rows.
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (*Turbo C++ specific*).
