# Find the Largest of Two Numbers Using if-else

This C++ program takes two integers as input and determines which number is larger using an `if-else` statement.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter two integers `a` and `b`
- Checks:
  - If `a > b`, prints "a is largest"
  - Otherwise, prints "b is largest"
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (*Turbo C++ specific*)

## 📋 Sample Output

a=10
b=7
a is largest

a=4
b=9
b is largest
