# Find the Largest of Two Numbers Using Conditional Operator

This C++ program determines the larger of two numbers entered by the user using the conditional (`?:`) operator.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter two integers `a` and `b`
- Uses the conditional operator to evaluate:
  - If `a > b`, `c = a`
  - Otherwise, `c = b`
- Prints the value of `c` as the largest number
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (*Turbo C++ specific*)

## 📋 Sample Output

Enter value of a:5  
Enter value of b:7  
7
