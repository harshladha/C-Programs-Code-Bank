# Area of Rectangle

This C++ program calculates and prints the area of a rectangle for given length and breadth inputs.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter:
  - Length (`l`)
  - Breadth (`b`)
- Calculates area:
  - `a = l * b`
- Prints the area of the rectangle
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (*Turbo C++ specific*)

## 📋 Sample Output

enter length5  
enter breadh4  
area of rectangle is 20
