# Area of Rectangle Using Function with Parameters and Return Value

This C++ program calculates the area of a rectangle by passing length and breadth to a function that returns the computed area.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Defines a function `area(int x, int y)`:
  - Multiplies `x` and `y` to get area
  - Returns the area as an integer
- In `main()`:
  - Prompts the user to enter the length and breadth
  - Calls `area(l, b)` and stores the result in `k`
  - Prints the area
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (*Turbo C++ specific*)

## 📋 Sample Output

Enter length of Rectangle:5  
Enter Breadth of Rectangle:4  
Area of rectangle=20
